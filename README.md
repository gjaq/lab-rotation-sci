# Studying missingness in serological markers in relationship to recovery after spinal cord injury

Lab rotation of Garance Jaques.

### Description

The objective of this study was to analyse the variety of serological markers that were collected during the first 2 weeks after spinal cord injury (SCI) and to assess whether they correlated to the severity of the injury. Several models, including Poisson and negative binomial models and their zero-inflated versions, were tested in order to model the number of blood draws as a function of the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade and the plegia. We then compared the marginal means (EMMs) estimated from the best-fitting model, i.e. zero- inflated negative binomial model. Those EMMs represent the estimated number of blood draws collected in the first two weeks for patients with different AIS grades and plegia. The EMM of paraplegic patients with sensorimotor complete SCI (AIS-A) are significantly higher that EMMs of patients with incomplete injuries (AIS-C and AIS-D) (adjusted p-values of 0.0008 and < 0.0001 respectively) and EMMs of tetraplegic patients with AIS-D are significantly lower than tetraplegic patients with more severe injuries (AIS-A to C, all adjusted p-values < 0.0001). This shows that, in general, a higher number of blood draws is collected from patients with more severe injuries. This study brings a new insight on the understanding of biomarkers as injury descriptors and could thus allow a better design and implementation of clinical trials.
